Input data:
###########

x 'features.txt': List of all features.
x 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
x 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
x 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
x 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
x 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
x 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity.
x 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity.


R script:
#########

The script does the following:
- Read data into R, there are 8 files to read (listed above) all of which are supplied as part of the course.
- Assign labels (variable names) to data.
- Merge training and test data set
- Extract variables (columns) containing "std" or "mean" (ignoring case): 86 columns
- Convert activity codes to descriptive activity names and add to data
- Add subject information to data, now 88 columns
- Group data by activity and subject
- Summarize data by calculating means for all 86 variables


Output data:
############

A data frame containing means of all 86 variables previously extracted for all combinations of subjects and
activities (30 subjects x 6 activities = 180 combinations).

It is tidy because it adheres to the tidy data principles:
- Each variable forms a column. 86 of the original variables, plus 2 extra variables: activity and subject.
- Each observation forms a row. Here the means of the input data.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table. It is only one table.
